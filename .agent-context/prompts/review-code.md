## The Prompt

```
Run a comprehensive code review on the current codebase (or the files I'm about to show you).

Use these checklists:
1. Read .agent-context/review-checklists/pr-checklist.md — apply every item.
2. Read .agent-context/review-checklists/security-audit.md — apply every item.

For EVERY violation found:
- State the exact file and line
- Reference the specific rule (file + section)
- Explain WHY it's a problem (not just "it violates the rule")
- Provide the corrected code

Output format:
## PR REVIEW RESULTS
PASS [Item]
FAIL [Item] (with Reasoning Chain)

## SECURITY AUDIT RESULTS
CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW [Finding] — severity + fix

VERDICT: PASS / FAIL
```

## Quick Review (Subset)

If you want a faster review focusing on the most critical items:

```
Quick review the current code. Check ONLY:
1. Any use of `any` type? (rules/stacks/typescript.md)
2. Any empty catch blocks? (rules/error-handling.md)
3. Any N+1 queries? (rules/performance.md)
4. Any hardcoded secrets? (rules/security.md)
5. Any missing input validation? (rules/security.md)

Use the Reasoning Clause for every finding.
```
